## Status

Early development phase, completely useless at the moment.

The intention is to make a p2pool for SIA. In a first phase the pool interface and blockgeneration will be created. This will result in a fully functional but centralized pplns pool. The sharechain and p2peer protocal will be added in phase 2.



## Support development
